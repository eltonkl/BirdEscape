Roll forward, move sideways to dodge walls, and pick up powerups to escape from the bird!
Every time the bird eats one of the balls, the bird loses some its velocity and is moved back a couple of units.
Once the bird has eaten all of the balls, the game ends.


Powerups: 
Pyramid: Creates a copy of the ball.
Cube: Increases forward velocity and horizontal velocity cap for a couple seconds.


Controls:
spacebar: Play/Pause
a: Move left
d: Move right


Hierarchical object: Bird (body + legs = 3-tiered)
Polygonal object: Pyramid and stage sidewalls 
Texture mapped objects: Pyramid and stage sidewalls
